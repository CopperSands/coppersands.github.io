Hello I'm CopperSands and this is my blog. I graduated from BYU with a degree in cybersecurity. I love tinkering with
different technologies from websites to containers, services, operating systems and networks. I have often made guides
for myself during my studies and I thought it would be fun to make a blog. 

It is hard first getting accustomed to new technologies. I have spent countless hours digging through documentation.
Most of the time digging is what you need to do to learn a technology well. Every system works a little different
and being able to understand a product like the developers is very valuable. 

That being said, I want to make this blog a place where new things are approachable. I want to be able to give a
short example, explanation, or demonstration of how a tool/principle can be used. I would highly encourage anyone
reading a guide or article to use provided links to referenced material or the official documentation of whatever service 
I make comments on. The real way to learn a tool or technology is to understand its inner workings. After reading/following
a post look up the official material, experiment, invent! Struggling is good for the soul. This is how you will learn.
